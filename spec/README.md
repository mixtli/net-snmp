Notes
-----

- To test sets, you have to have a local snmpd running with write permissions
- For your local agent, use read community "public" & write community "private"
- A free simulator can be downloaded from [veraxsystems](http://www.veraxsystems.com/en/products/free-snmp-agent-simulator)
  + TODO: This simulator could be used to replace the dependency on test.net-snmp.org
